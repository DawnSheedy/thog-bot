# Thog Bot

thog is a bot based on [this meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thog-dont-caare)

thog responds to any question that is asked in every channel he can see with "thog dont caare"

there is an official version of thog (Verified by discord and used in about 400 servers, if you can believe it) that can be added to your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=547202888150024202&permissions=100352&scope=bot)

this version of thog is missing features present in the hosted version, as this is a rewrite to be closer to the true idea of thog: ***simplicity.***
